The plugin API also exposes certain parts of the store's reducer. You can target these reducers by exporting one of the decorating functions described on this page (more may be added in the future).

Available extensions:

A description of reducers in redux from the [docs](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers):

>Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe the fact that something happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.

So with these extensions, you are indicating how you want the app state to change based on specific actions that have been [dispatched](/bpanel-docs/docs/api-map-state-dispatch.html) to the store. Each individual reducer extension is targeting a specific part of the state.

To get information about the shape of the part of the state you would like to interact with, we recommend using the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension).

__NOTE__: The state in bPanel is kept immutable using the [`seamless-immutable`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seamless-immutable) library. Read more about their API in the docs to learn how to update the state.

## Available Reducers:
### `reduceChain`
Actions types currently implemented in the chain reducer are:

- `SET_CHAIN_INFO`
- `SET_GENESIS`

Example:
```
// This will return an immutable version of state with a new `snapshot` property that is a snapshot of the current tip hash.
// Pretty useless reducer but gives an idea of functionality
export const reduceChain = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'MY_CUSTOM_ACTION': {
      const snapshot = state.getIn(['tip']);
      return state.set('snapshot', snapshot);
    }
  }
}
```
