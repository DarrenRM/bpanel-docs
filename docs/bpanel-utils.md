bpanel-utils is a separate npm module that plugin developers can use to solve commonly encountered errors. This allows for some standardization around certain operations. Developers that feel they have a utility that can help other plugin devs should also be encouraged to extend this utility library.

Install locally to your plugin with

```bash
npm install --save-dev 'bpanel-utils'
```

and then import into your project files as needed.

### `api`
The API methods will return the string that maps to the path you need for specific requests. The idea is to have a way to help plugin developers ensure that their API stays consistent with the app server if there are any future changes. The primary function now is to prepend the `node` and `wallet` prefixes on the path so the app server knows to route requests to bcoin.

#### `get`
  - `block`: Params (heightOrHash)
  - `info`: Params ()
  - `wallet`: Params (walletId)
  - `accounts`: Params (walletId)
  - `account`: Params (walletId, accountId)

#### `post`
  - `tx`: Params (walletId)

### `chain`
Helper functions for working with the blockchain.

#### `getBlock`
Does a request to the node for the block information. Accepts one argument of either a block hash or height to query.

Returns a promise.

#### `calcProgress`
Based on a chain start time (time of the genesis block) and the current chain tip time, will calculate the progress of the blockchain sync.

Returns an integer.

#### `getBlocksInRange`
Return n number of blocks within a specified range. Accepts three arguments: start, end, and step.

if start is larger than end, it steps backwards, otherwise steps forward. Does synchronous calls to the node for each block so it won't return until all calls have returned.

Returns an array of blocks.

### `helpers`
#### `now()`
Returns the current UTC time in seconds.
