The easiest way to learn about and experiment with bPanel UI components
is through the demo plugin `BUI` bPanel. This plugin adds a view to your
bPanel install that demonstrates the use of all available components
in the bPanel UI library.

## Consistent Styling
The best part about using bPanel UI components in your plugin views
is that they will automatically reflect updates to your active theme.
Since all components are connected to the themeVariables and themeConfig
via the [`connectTheme` HOC](/docs/ui-utilities.html#connectTheme),
if you change your app's theme, the changes will be reflected in the component.
These can even be extended via theme prop if you want.

## Get Started with BUI
Try it out for yourself!

```bash
npm install --save @bpanel/bui
```

Add `BUI` to your bPanel install to see what's available.
```javascript
// ~/.bpanel/config.js
export const localPlugins = [];
export const plugins = ['@bpanel/bui'];
export default { localPlugins, plugins };
```

Using components is as easy as:
```bash
npm install @bpanel/bpanel-ui
```

```
import { Text, Header } from '@bpanel/bpanel-ui';

export default () => (
  <div>
    <Header type="h2">Hello World</Header>
  </div>
);
```
