# Description
A simple, blank panel view for bPanel that can be decorated by widgets.
The Dashboard comes pre-loaded with some intro text that explains how to use it.
This won't be rendered once other widgets have been installed.

You can read more about how widgets work and how to build your own in our
[documentation](https://bpanel.org/docs/api-decorate-plugins.html).

Here are some widgets you can install to get you started:

- [@bpanel/recent-blocks](/tutorials/recent_blocks.html)
- [@bpanel/peers-widget](/tutorials/peers_widget.html)
- [@bpanel/mempool-widget](/tutorials/mempool_widget.html)

Use [bpanel-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bpanel/bpanel-cli) to install as many
widgets or other plugins as you want!
