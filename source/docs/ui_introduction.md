The bPanel UI library is a way to offer easy to re-use
components and utilities for building out interfaces in bPanel.
Using this toolset will allow for quick iteration and also
make it easier to ensure that your views reflect theme and platform updates.

If you're familiar with UI libraries like [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com)
or [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) then you should be able to get up
and running quickly. Simply `npm install --save @bpanel/bpanel-ui` into your plugin
you can import all of the available components and utilities.
